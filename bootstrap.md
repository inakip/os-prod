BCPC Cluster Bootstrap Overview
===============================

This repository contains a set of scripts that is useful to bootstrap a BCPC
cluster with a Cobbler, Chef, DHCP, and gateway server.  Once the
bcpc-bootstrap node is created, all of the other nodes (such as bcpc-vm1,
bcpc-vm2, bcpc-vm3, etc.) can be PXE-booted with a valid image and then
chef-ified with minimal effort.

If you have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed, you can use our included
Vagrantfile and an Ubuntu 12.04 box file to provision a bootstrap node that is
able to act as the provisioning server with minimal interaction.

If you do not wish to use Vagrant or have a bare metal installation and wish to
do a manual install of the bootstrap node, you can use our bootstrap_chef.sh
scripts to bring a bare Ubuntu 12.04 image up as a provisioning server.

Once the bootstrap node is provisioned, then you can PXE-boot the other virtual
machines and enroll them in the cluster as head and worker nodes as you deem
appropriate.

Finally, if you do not wish to use our scripts (we won't be offended), please
refer to the [manual instructions](#manual-setup-notes) at the end of this
document.

Kicking off the bootstrap process
=================================

To start off, create the VirtualBox images:

```
$ ./vbox_create.sh
```

This will create four VMs:
- bcpc-bootstrap (cobbler and chef server)
- bcpc-vm1
- bcpc-vm2
- bcpc-vm3

If you have vagrant installed, the ``vbox_create.sh`` script will automatically
begin the provisioning of the bcpc-bootstrap node.  This may take 30-45 minutes
to complete successfully.  See below for [notes around the Vagrant
installation](#bcpc-bootstrap-creation-with-vagrant).  Otherwise, you can
provision the bcpc-bootstrap node through included shell scripts - see below
for
[installation notes without Vagrant](#bcpc-bootstrap-creation-without-vagrant).

Once the bcpc-bootstrap node is available, the bcpc-vm images will be able to
be configured and boot via PXE.  Once the initial bootstrap process is complete
and the bcpc-vm machines are
[enrolled in Cobbler](#registering-vms-for-pxe-boot), the bcpc-vm machines
should automatically begin installation upon bootup.

In our testing, VirtualBox guest SMP makes performance significantly worse, so
it is recommended that you keep one CPU per VM.  You may also find that 2GB is
not enough for a BCPC-Headnode and wish to tweak the amount of RAM given to
any head node VM.

bcpc-bootstrap creation with Vagrant
====================================

If vagrant is locally installed, we utilize the
[vagrant box images from Canonical](http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/)
to provision the bcpc-bootstrap node.

If you have a [local repository mirror](#setting-up-a-private-repos-mirror),
you can alter the Vagrantfile to use it when provisioning:

```
$local_mirror = "10.0.100.4"
```

You can log in to your bcpc-bootstrap node from the hypervisor via:

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

After the automatic provisioning is complete, this is a good time to take a
snapshot of your bootstrap node:

```
$ VBoxManage snapshot bcpc-bootstrap take initial-install
```

Please continue to
[Registering VMs for PXE boot](#registering-vms-for-pxe-boot).

bcpc-bootstrap creation without Vagrant
=======================================

If you do not have Vagrant installed, the ``vbox_create.sh`` script will create
the appropriate VMs.  You will then need to bring up the bcpc-bootstrap VM -
which has a virtual CD attached to kick off the Ubuntu install:

```
$ VBoxManage startvm bcpc-bootstrap
```

Manual install notes:

- select eth0 as network interface for DHCP (vbox_create.sh sets it up as NAT)
- bcpc-bootstrap as hostname
- ubuntu/ubuntu as default user/password
- install OpenSSH server
- install grub to MBR

Login to new VM.

If using NAT, port 22 inbound may be blocked; so, set up the other interfaces
on the hostonlyif ifaces (eth1-3).  Add to /etc/network/interfaces on
bcpc-bootstrap:

```
# Static interfaces
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
  address 10.0.100.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0

auto eth2
iface eth2 inet static
  address 172.16.100.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0

auto eth3
iface eth3 inet static
  address 192.168.100.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0
```

After changing the interfaces file:

```
# service networking restart
```

This is a good time to take a snapshot of your bootstrap node:

```
$ VBoxManage snapshot bcpc-bootstrap take initial-install
```

Provisioning chef-server without Vagrant
----------------------------------------

Once you can SSH in to the bcpc-bootstrap node (ssh ubuntu@10.0.100.1 if
following instructions above), you can then run the bootstrap_chef.sh script
from the hypervisor running VirtualBox:

```
$ ./bootstrap_chef.sh 10.0.100.1
```

- Chef server URL: http://10.0.100.1:4000
- Chef password: chef (must not be blank or chef-solr will not start)
- You can leave chef-server-webui pw blank (will default to admin/p@ssw0rd1)

This will bring up the chef-server on http://10.0.100.1:4040.

Initial knife questions without Vagrant
---------------------------------------

You will be asked to set up your knife setup on the bcpc-bootstrap node.
The path to the chef repository must be . (period) to work.

```
Where should I put the config file? [/home/ubuntu/.chef/knife.rb] .chef/knife.rb
Please enter the chef server URL: [http://bcpc-bootstrap:4000] http://10.0.100.1:4000
Please enter a clientname for the new client: [ubuntu] 
Please enter the existing admin clientname: [chef-webui] 
Please enter the location of the existing admin client's private key: [/etc/chef/webui.pem] 
Please enter the validation clientname: [chef-validator] 
Please enter the location of the validation key: [/etc/chef/validation.pem] 
Please enter the path to a chef repository (or leave blank): .
```

At this point, your bcpc-bootstrap node should be appropriately provisioned.

This is a good time to take a snapshot of your bootstrap node:

```
$ VBoxManage snapshot bcpc-bootstrap take chef-server-provisioned
```

Registering VMs for PXE boot
============================

Once you have provisioned the local Chef server (via Vagrant or
bootstrap_chef.sh), you will need to register the bcpc-vm1, bcpc-vm2, and
bcpc-vm3 VMs.  You can do this through:

```
$ ./enroll_cobbler.sh
```

If you have other VMs to register:

```
cobbler system add --name=bcpc-vm10 --hostname=bcpc-vm10 --profile=bcpc_host --ip-address=10.0.100.20 --mac=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

User account on VM
==================

Upon PXE boot imaging, the bcpc-vm boxes will be imaged with the auto-generated
password for the ubuntu user.  From the bootstrap node, you can retrieve the
password as:

```
ubuntu@bcpc-bootstrap:~/chef-bcpc$ knife data bag show configs Test-Laptop
cobbler-root-password:         abcdefgh
...
ubuntu@bcpc-bootstrap:~/chef-bcpc$ ssh ubuntu@10.0.100.11 uname -a
ubuntu@10.0.100.11's password: <type in abcdefgh>
Linux bcpc-vm1 3.2.0-41-generic #66-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 25 03:27:11 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Assigning roles to VM
=====================

At this point, you can then run:
```
$ sudo knife bootstrap -E Test-Laptop -r 'role[BCPC-Headnode]' 10.0.100.11
$ sudo knife bootstrap -E Test-Laptop -r 'role[BCPC-Worknode]' 10.0.100.12
$ sudo knife bootstrap -E Test-Laptop -r 'role[BCPC-Worknode]' 10.0.100.12
```

Also, after the first run, make the client an administrator, or you will get the error:
'''
[...]error: Net::HTTPServerException: 403 "Forbidden"
'''
To make a host an administrator, one can access the Chef web UI via
http://10.0.100.1:4040 and follow:
Clients -> <Host> -> Edit -> Admin (toggle true) -> Save Client
Then, re-run the bootstrap command.

Using BCPC
==========

If the VIP is configured against 10.0.100.5 (this is the default for the
Test-Laptop environment), then you can go to ``https://10.0.100.5/horizon/`` to
go to the OpenStack interface.  To find the OpenStack credentials, look in the
data bag for your environment under ``keystone-admin-user`` and
``keystone-admin-password``:

```
$ knife data bag show configs Test-Laptop | grep keystone-admin
keystone-admin-password:       abcdefgh
keystone-admin-token:          this-is-my-token
keystone-admin-user:           admin

```

To check on ``Ceph``:

```
ubuntu@bcpc-vm1:~$ ceph -s
   health HEALTH_OK
   monmap e1: 1 mons at {bcpc-vm1=172.16.100.11:6789/0}, election epoch 2, quorum 0 bcpc-vm1
   osdmap e94: 12 osds: 12 up, 12 in
    pgmap v705: 2192 pgs: 2192 active+clean; 80333 KB data, 729 MB used, 227 GB / 227 GB avail
   mdsmap e4: 1/1/1 up {0=bcpc-vm1=up:active}
```

Setting up a private repos mirror
=================================

If you do a lot of installations or are on an isolated network, you may wish to
utilize a private mirror.  Currently, this will require about 100GB of local
storage.

```
ubuntu@bcpc-bootstrap:~$ knife node run_list add \`hostname -f\` 'recipe[bcpc::apache-mirror]'
ubuntu@bcpc-bootstrap:~$ knife node run_list add \`hostname -f\` 'recipe[bcpc::apt-mirror]'
ubuntu@bcpc-bootstrap:~$ sudo chef-client
ubuntu@bcpc-bootstrap:~$ sudo apt-mirror /etc/apt/mirror.list
```

After successfully downloading the repository mirrors, you will then need to
edit the local environment - the following patch highlights the necessary
settings:

```

Manual setup notes
==================

This records notes if you do not wish to use Vagrant or our included shell
scripts to provision the bootstrap nodes.

Step 1 - One-time setup
----------------------

Make sure that you have `rubygems` and `chef` installed. Currently this only works on `chef@10.18` which requires some massaging to install due to a newer version of `net-ssh`.

```
 $ [sudo] gem install net-ssh -v 2.2.2 --no-ri --no-rdoc
 $ [sudo] gem install net-ssh-gateway -v 1.1.0 --no-ri --no-rdoc --ignore-dependencies
 $ [sudo] gem install net-ssh-multi -v 1.1.0 --no-ri --no-rdoc --ignore-dependencies
 $ [sudo] gem install chef --no-ri --no-rdoc -v 10.18
```

These cookbooks assume that you already have the following cookbooks
available:
 - apt
 - ubuntu
 - cron
 - chef-client

You can install these cookbooks via:

```
 $ cd cookbooks/
 $ knife cookbook site download apt  
 $ knife cookbook site download ubuntu  
 $ knife cookbook site download cron
 $ knife cookbook site download chef-client  
```

This will download the cookbooks locally. You need to untar them into `/cookbooks`:

```
 $ tar -zxvf apt*.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxvf ubuntu*.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxvf cron*.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxvf chef-client*.tar.gz
 $ rm apt*.tar.gz ubuntu*.tar.gz rm cron*.tar.gz chef-client*.tar.gz
 $ cd ../
```

You also need to build the installer bins for a number of external
dependencies, and there's a script to help (tested on Ubuntu 12.04)

```
 $ ./cookbooks/bcpc/files/default/build_bins.sh
```

If you're planning to run OpenStack on top of VirtualBox, be sure to build the base VirtualBox images first:

```
 $ cd path/to/chef-bcpc
 $ ./vbox_create.sh
```

Step 2 - Prep the servers
----------------------

After you've set up your own environment file, get everything up to your
chef server:

```
 $ knife environment from file environments/*.json  
 $ knife role from file roles/*.json  
 $ knife cookbook upload -a
```
