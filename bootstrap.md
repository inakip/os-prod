BCPC Cluster Bootstrap Overview
===============================

This repository contains a set of scripts that is useful to bootstrap a BCPC
cluster with a Cobbler, Chef, DHCP, and gateway server.  Once the
bcpc-bootstrap node is created, all of the other nodes (such as bcpc-vm1,
bcpc-vm2, bcpc-vm3, etc.) can be PXE-booted with a valid image and then
chef-ified with minimal effort.

You are only required to bring up a bare Ubuntu 12.04 image before running the
bootstrap_chef.sh script - it will take the image the rest of the way
installing all of the good stuff.

If you do not wish to use our scripts (we won't be offended), please refer to
the manual instructions at the end of this document.

Kicking off the bootstrap process
=================================

To start off, create the VirtualBox images:

```
$ ./vbox_create.sh
```

This will create four VMs:
- bcpc-bootstrap (cobbler and chef server)
- bcpc-vm1
- bcpc-vm2
- bcpc-vm3

The bcpc-vm images will not work appropriately until the bcpc-bootstrap node is
configured and serving images via PXE and has the firewall rules in place.
Once the initial bootstrap process is complete, they should automatically begin
installation upon bootup.

Then, bring up the bcpc-bootstrap VM - which has a virtual CD attached to
kick off the Ubuntu install:

```
$ VBoxManage startvm bcpc-bootstrap
```

bcpc-bootstrap creation notes
=============================

If you have a base Ubuntu 12.04 image available through other means, you can
skip this step as long as you set up the appropriate interfaces and such.

Install notes:

- select eth3 as network interface for DHCP (vbox_create.sh sets it up as NAT)
- bcpc-bootstrap as hostname
- ubuntu/ubuntu as default user/password
- install grub to MBR
- remove virtual CD

Login to new VM.

If using NAT, port 22 inbound may be blocked; so, set up the other interfaces
on the hostonlyif ifaces (eth0-2).  Add to /etc/network/interfaces on
bcpc-bootstrap:

```
# Static interfaces
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 10.0.100.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
  address 172.16.100.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0

auto eth2
iface eth2 inet static
  address 192.168.100.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0
```

After changing the interfaces file:

```
# service networking restart
```

This is a good time to take a snapshot of your bootstrap node:

```
$ VBoxManage snapshot bcpc-bootstrap take initial-install
```

bootstrap_chef.sh
=================

Once you can SSH in to the bcpc-bootstrap node (ssh ubuntu@10.0.100.1 if
following instructions above), you can then run the bootstrap_chef.sh script
from the hypervisor running VirtualBox:

```
$ ./bootstrap_chef.sh 10.0.100.1
```

- Chef server URL: http://10.0.100.1:4000
- Chef password: chef (must not be blank or chef-solr will not start)
- You can leave chef-server-webui pw blank (will default to admin/p@ssw0rd1)
  http://10.0.100.1:4040

Initial knife questions
=======================

You will be asked to set up your knife setup on the bcpc-bootstrap node.
The path to the chef repository must be . (period) to work.

```
Where should I put the config file? [/home/ubuntu/.chef/knife.rb] .chef/knife.rb
Please enter the chef server URL: [http://bcpc-bootstrap:4000] http://10.0.100.1:4000
Please enter a clientname for the new client: [ubuntu] 
Please enter the existing admin clientname: [chef-webui] 
Please enter the location of the existing admin client's private key: [/etc/chef/webui.pem] 
Please enter the validation clientname: [chef-validator] 
Please enter the location of the validation key: [/etc/chef/validation.pem] 
Please enter the path to a chef repository (or leave blank): .
```

You will eventually be prompted to make the initial client an admin - just
modify the admin flag to true and save the file.

Registering VMs for PXE boot
============================

If you use the bootstrap_chef.sh script, it will automatically register
bcpc-vm1, bcpc-vm2, and bcpc-vm3 VMs.  If you have other VMs to register:

```
cobbler system add --name=bcpc-vm10 --hostname=bcpc-vm10 --profile=bcpc_host --ip-address=10.0.100.20 --mac=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

User account on VM
==================

Upon PXE boot imaging, the bcpc-vm boxes will be imaged with the auto-generated
password for the ubuntu user.  From the bootstrap node, you can retrieve the
password as:

```
ubuntu@bcpc-bootstrap:~/chef-bcpc$ knife data bag show configs Test-Laptop
cobbler-root-password:         abcdefgh
...
ubuntu@bcpc-bootstrap:~/chef-bcpc$ ssh ubuntu@10.0.100.11 uname -a
ubuntu@10.0.100.11's password: <type in abcdefgh>
Linux bcpc-vm1 3.2.0-41-generic #66-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 25 03:27:11 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Assigning roles to VM
=====================

At this point, you can then run:
```
$ knife bootstrap -E Test-Laptop -r 'role[BCPC-Headnode]' 10.0.100.11
$ knife bootstrap -E Test-Laptop -r 'role[BCPC-Worknode]' 10.0.100.12
$ knife bootstrap -E Test-Laptop -r 'role[BCPC-Worknode]' 10.0.100.12
```

Using BCPC
==========

If the VIP is configured against 10.0.100.5 (this is the default for the
Test-Laptop environment), then you can go to ``https://10.0.100.5/horizon/`` to
go to the OpenStack interface.  To find the OpenStack credentials, look in the
data bag for your environment under ``keystone-admin-user`` and
``keystone-admin-password``:

```
$ knife data bag show configs Test-Laptop | grep keystone-admin
keystone-admin-password:       abcdefgh
keystone-admin-token:          this-is-my-token
keystone-admin-user:           admin

```

To check on ``Ceph``:

```
ubuntu@bcpc-vm1:~$ ceph -s
   health HEALTH_OK
   monmap e1: 1 mons at {bcpc-vm1=172.16.100.11:6789/0}, election epoch 2, quorum 0 bcpc-vm1
   osdmap e94: 12 osds: 12 up, 12 in
    pgmap v705: 2192 pgs: 2192 active+clean; 80333 KB data, 729 MB used, 227 GB / 227 GB avail
   mdsmap e4: 1/1/1 up {0=bcpc-vm1=up:active}
```

Manual setup notes
==================

Step 1 - One-time setup
----------------------

Make sure that you have `rubygems` and `chef` installed. Currently this only works on `chef@10.18` which requires some massaging to install due to a newer version of `net-ssh`.

```
 $ [sudo] gem install net-ssh -v 2.2.2 --no-ri --no-rdoc
 $ [sudo] gem install net-ssh-gateway -v 1.1.0 --no-ri --no-rdoc --ignore-dependencies
 $ [sudo] gem install net-ssh-multi -v 1.1.0 --no-ri --no-rdoc --ignore-dependencies
 $ [sudo] gem install chef --no-ri --no-rdoc -v 10.18
```

These cookbooks assume that you already have the following cookbooks
available:
 - apt
 - ubuntu
 - cron
 - chef-client

You can install these cookbooks via:

```
 $ cd cookbooks/
 $ knife cookbook site download apt  
 $ knife cookbook site download ubuntu  
 $ knife cookbook site download cron
 $ knife cookbook site download chef-client  
```

This will download the cookbooks locally. You need to untar them into `/cookbooks`:

```
 $ tar -zxvf apt*.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxvf ubuntu*.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxvf cron*.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxvf chef-client*.tar.gz
 $ rm apt*.tar.gz ubuntu*.tar.gz rm cron*.tar.gz chef-client*.tar.gz
 $ cd ../
```

You also need to build the installer bins for a number of external
dependencies, and there's a script to help (tested on Ubuntu 12.04)

```
 $ ./cookbooks/bcpc/files/default/build_bins.sh
```

If you're planning to run OpenStack on top of VirtualBox, be sure to build the base VirtualBox images first:

```
 $ cd path/to/chef-bcpc
 $ ./vbox_create.sh
```

Step 2 - Prep the servers
----------------------

After you've set up your own environment file, get everything up to your
chef server:

```
 $ knife environment from file environments/*.json  
 $ knife role from file roles/*.json  
 $ knife cookbook upload -a
```
